Two Tables Design Recipe Template

1. Extract nouns from the user stories or specification
# EXAMPLE USER STORY:
# (analyse only the relevant part - here, the final line).

As a coach
So I can get to know all students
I want to see a list of students' names.

As a coach
So I can get to know all students
I want to see a list of cohorts' names.

As a coach
So I can get to know all students
I want to see a list of cohorts' starting dates.

As a coach
So I can get to know all students
I want to see a list of students' cohorts.

Nouns:
students, students names, cohorts names, cohorts starting dates

2. Infer the Table Name and Columns
Put the different nouns in this table. Replace the example with your own nouns.

Record	Properties
student	student_name
cohort	cohort_name, cohort_start_date

Name of the first table (always plural): students

Column names: namne

Name of the second table (always plural): cohorts

Column names: name, start_date

3. Decide the column types
Here's a full documentation of PostgreSQL data types.

Most of the time, you'll need either text, int, bigint, numeric, or boolean. If you're in doubt, do some research or ask your peers.

Remember to always have the primary key id as a first column. Its type will always be SERIAL.

# EXAMPLE:

Table: students
id: SERIAL
name: text

Table: cohorts
id: SERIAL
name: text
start_date: date

4. Decide on The Tables Relationship
Most of the time, you'll be using a one-to-many relationship, and will need a foreign key on one of the two tables.

To decide on which one, answer these two questions:

Can one [TABLE ONE] have many [TABLE TWO]? (Yes/No) No
Can one [TABLE TWO] have many [TABLE ONE]? (Yes/No) Yes
You'll then be able to say that:

[A] has many [B]
And on the other side, [B] belongs to [A]
In that case, the foreign key is in the table [B]
Replace the relevant bits in this example with your own:

# EXAMPLE

1. Can one artist have many albums? YES
2. Can one album have many artists? NO

-> Therefore,
-> An artist HAS MANY albums
-> An album BELONGS TO an artist

-> Therefore, the foreign key is on the albums table.
If you can answer YES to the two questions, you'll probably have to implement a Many-to-Many relationship, which is more complex and needs a third table (called a join table).

students is foreign key

5. Write the SQL
-- EXAMPLE
-- file: student_directory_2.sql

-- Replace the table name, columm names and types.

-- Create the table without the foreign key first.
CREATE TABLE cohorts (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name text,
  starting_date date
);

-- Then the table with the foreign key second.
CREATE TABLE students (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name text,
-- The foreign key name is always {other_table_singular}_id
  cohort_id int,
  constraint fk_cohort foreign key(cohort_id)
    references cohorts(id)
    on delete cascade
);
6. Create the tables
psql -h 127.0.0.1 database_name < albums_table.sql
